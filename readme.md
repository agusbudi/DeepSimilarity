disclaimer:
I created this repo for trying image similarity with VGG16, VGG19, and Resnet50. Here is my colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PhR5sPv6X8tKBud5QV9x_xIMrwZYhGS8

Source of original code and images data:
1.  https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models
2. https://github.com/XingLiangLondon/Image-Similarity-in-Percentage

I did some modification in VGG16.py : change from keras.engine.topology import get_source_inputs to from keras.utils.layer_utils import get_source_inputs

Dataset:
- The HyperKvasir Dataset https://osf.io/mh9sj/

Thank you for your visit!
